# SQL Jinja template to train regression model on BigQuery ML.
#
# Args:
#  model_path: Full path to model in BigQuery. Ex: project.dataset.model.
#  model_type: Type of the model. Should be one of:
#    - 'LINEAR_REG'
#    - 'AUTOML_REGRESSOR'
#    - 'BOOSTED_TREE_REGRESSOR'
#    - 'DNN_REGRESSOR'
#  l2_reg: The amount of L2 regularization applied.
#  max_iterations: The maximum number of training iterations or steps.
#  learn_rate_strategy: The strategy for specifying the learning rate during training.
#  early_stop: Whether training should stop if relative loss improvement is less
#    than the value specified for MIN_REL_PROGRESS.
#  min_rel_progress: The minimum relative loss improvement that is necessary to
#    continue training when EARLY_STOP is set to true.
#  enable_global_explain: Whether to compute global explanations to evaluate
#    global feature importance to the model.
#  target_column: Column name containing labels. Ex: 'label_column'.
#  feature_columns: List of columns containing features. Ex: ['col1', 'col2'].
#  features_table_path: Full path to table containing training datset in BigQuery.
#    Ex: project.dataset.table.
#  data_split_col: A column used to split the data. This column cannot be used
#    as a feature or label, and will be excluded from features automatically.
#    For more detials, refer to https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs/reference/standard-sql/bigqueryml-syntax-create#data_split_col
#  budget_hours: Sets the training budget for AutoML Tables training,
#    specified in hours. Defaults to 1.0 and must be between 1.0 and 72.0.
#    This option can only be used if MODEL_TYPE is AUTOML_REGRESSOR.
