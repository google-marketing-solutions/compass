For example, when N = 10, it creates 10 bins such that the first bin contains the top 10% instances with the highest probability, the second bin contains the top 20% instances with the highest probability and so on where the last bin contains all the instances.\n",

Calculates the Precision, Precision Uplift (Precision of the bin divided by the proportion of positive instances in the dataset indicating the Precision of selecting a random sample of the size of the bin) and Coverage (or Recall = the proportion of positive instances in the bin out of all the positive instances in the dataset) for each bin.\n",
